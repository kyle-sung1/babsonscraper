TODO: 
- [x] we could run scheduling, so that you cannot call getPeriod("breakfast") past breakfast, since that raises an error. Instead, add 1 to the date so that it returns the breakfast menu for tomorrow. Or we could return an error like "Cant look at breakfast menu past breakfast"
- [x] implement flask backend and a db that stores menu items throughout day and purges at night to save memory
- [x] implement frontend...using dart?
